# Udemy Course Analysis

## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze the Udemy course dataset using Python. 
The dataset contains various attributes of Udemy courses, such as course ID, title, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, and more. 
The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover insights and trends within the dataset.

## Files and Folders
Udemy Course Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code.
data.csv: The Udemy course dataset used for the analysis.

## Project Structure
**Importing Libraries and Loading Data -**
Import necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Load the Udemy course dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

**Data Exploration -**
Display the first and last 5 rows of the dataset.
Display the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.
Get information about the dataset, including data types and memory usage.
Check for missing values in the dataset.

**Data Visualization -**
Visualize the distribution of course prices.
Plot the correlation between course attributes (e.g., price, number of subscribers, number of reviews).

## Key Insights 
**Top Course Categories:** The top course categories include Web Development, Business Finance, and Graphic Design.

**Course Durations:** The distribution of course durations indicates that most courses are between 1 and 6 hours long.

**Correlation Analysis:** The correlation analysis reveals that there is a positive correlation between course price and 
number of subscribers, indicating that more expensive courses tend to attract more subscribers.

## Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Udemy course dataset, highlighting key trends and insights. 
The findings can help course creators optimize their pricing and content strategies to attract more learners. 
Additionally, the project demonstrates the use of Python and data visualization libraries to analyze and present complex data effectively.
